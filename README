This is the XNA4 Specification Mismatch Test Program for FNA.

This program exists as a quick test to make sure that we don't have any
unintended violations in FNA's exports, which could lead to ABI breakages and
compatibility issues with the original XNA libraries.

This was originally written by Nick Gravelyn and is now maintained by the FNA
team. Thanks to Nick for this program!
